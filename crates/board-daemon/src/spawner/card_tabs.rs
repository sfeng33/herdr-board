//! Shared card-tab allocation state.
//!
//! Two *different* callers place panes into a card's durable `card-<id>` tab:
//! dispatch (through [`HerdrSpawner::spawn`](super::HerdrSpawner)) and the
//! `run.focus` rescue (through [`super::rescue_run_pane`]). Board requests are
//! served concurrently — one task per connection — so they can race, and each
//! race would create a *second* `card-<id>` tab or a second pane in it.
//!
//! Both therefore share one registry rather than each keeping their own: the
//! per-key mutex serializes first allocation, and the ownership map remembers
//! the exact tab/anchor ids so the next allocation reuses them instead of
//! creating another tab. Labels are never ownership; only these exact ids are.
