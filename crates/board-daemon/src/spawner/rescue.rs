//! Ephemeral rescue of a run whose pane is gone.
//!
//! This is the placement + launch half of the `run.focus` rescue, factored out
//! of `Spawner::spawn` so it can be reused **without** the run-promotion path
//! that writes to the database. A rescue deliberately persists nothing: the
//! historical `runs` row stays immutable, so the pane created here has no run
//! row and is therefore not owned, watched, or timed out by the daemon.
//!
//! The dead pane id is never reused or revived; a brand-new tab is created next
//! to the card's tab and the harness conversation is resumed in it.
//!
//! Concurrency: a rescue places panes into the very same `card-<id>` tabs as
//! dispatch, and board requests are served concurrently (one task per
//! connection), so it takes the shared per-card allocation lock from
//! [`CardTabRegistry`] and registers what it allocated there. Without that, two
//! simultaneous focus requests — or a focus racing a dispatch — would each
//! create a pane, or a whole second `card-<id>` tab.
